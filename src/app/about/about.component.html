<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Rony Boscan, I'm a 4th semester student of the Computer Programming (CPP) Program on Seneca College, in Toronto, Canada. I come from Venezuela, where I previously graduated as a Mechanical Engineer.</p>
<p>My passion for programming came before going to college back in my home country. I first started learning to make web pages on my own as a hobby during my last year of school, and during the break before starting college I landed a job as an IT help desk assistant. It was during this time that I got assigned the task of developing a web application to handle the internal support requests; so in a matter of months I learned on my own JavaScript, ASP.Net and SQL using MS Access, to develop the application.</p>
<p>After graduating and having worked for a few years in the field, I realized that the Mechanical Engineering career was not fulfilling my hopes and expectations, and that the working experienced I had enjoyed the most so far was the one as a programmer. That was when I decided to do what I most liked and enrolled on the program.</p>
